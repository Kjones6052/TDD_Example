Project Name: TDD Example

Action Steps Taken:
1. create project folder
2. create Python vitrual environment
3. activate Python vitrual environment
4. pip install flask
5. create app.py file
6. create .gitignore file and add Python virtual environment to ignore list
7. create test_app.py file to write test cases (red stage)
8. create test case for /sum endpoint (red stage)
9. run test_app.py file => should fail => failed (red stage)
10. create test_results.txt file and add first test results
11. create /sum endpoint route to get sum of two numbers (green stage)
12. run test, add results to txt file
13. simplify code for /sum endpoint route (refactor stage)
14. add error handling to /sum endpoint route (refactor stage)
15. run test, add results to txt file
16. deactivate Python virtual environment
17. create github repository and connect to project folder
18. push project folder to github repository

Project Notes:
TDD => Test Driven Development

write the tests before writing the code 

helps improve code quality, speeds up development, and reduces bugs

TDD Cycle = Red - Green - Refactor
Red = write a test that fails, testing for functionality means the test should fail due to no implemented functionality
Greed = write the simplest code that passes the test, discard any code that doesn't serve the purpose
Refactor = improve the code, make it cleaner, more readable, and more efficient

Unit Testing = test individual components in isolation to handle bugs
 - the results of tests and the state of the application should not change the results of the test
 
when refactoring code consider error handling, use try/except blocks to handle any potential errors
