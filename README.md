# **Hello World!**

The files contained in this repository were designed and created as an example of TDD => Test Driven Development.


-------
What is TDD?
Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a code development strategy that is focused on testing to ensure the code serves the specific purpose 
it is intended to serve. 
-------

-------
How does it work?
TDD utilizes a cycle of stages; Red, Green, and Refactor. In the red stage we focus on writing tests for the application to pass after we have 
developed the code. In this stage our goal is to define the purpose we want to achieve. In the green stage we write the code that allows us to 
pass the tests we created. In the refactor stage we go back through our code with a fine tooth comb to take out anything unnecessary and if needed 
add in any required error handling.
-------

-------
Why is it useful?
TDD is useful because it forces us to focus our code writing efforts on completing a specific task, and by focusing on the test prior to the code to solve the test we can be certain to achieve the goal as efficiently as possible.
